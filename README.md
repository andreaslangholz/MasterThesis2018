"Danish Labour Supply with Human Capital - Evidendence from a Structural Life-Cycle Model"
by Andreas Langholz

The 0.Master file is the main script from which the other files are run sequentially, except for the datageneration file in SAS which serves as guideline for the data generation process.

The model is programmed from scratch in R v.3.4.3, with an additional SAS script for the initial  data generation process. The data is from Danish registers at Statistics Denmark, supplied by the Danish Ministry of Finance - Office for Labour Market Policy through the Lovmodel agreement. Due to data sensitivy, the full dataset cannot be supplied, but all parameters for simulation purposes are available in the paper. 

Feel free to contact me regarding the model at langholz.a@gmail.com.

Enjoy!
